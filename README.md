# Problem Statement

In the ever-evolving landscape of professional basketball, the NBA (National Basketball Association) stands as a beacon of competitive excellence, drawing innumerable fans and sparking passionate debates about team performances, player abilities, and statistical achievements. Within this dynamic context, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of NBA player statistics for the 2022-23 season and team-level performance.

The primary aim of this project is to provide a rigorous, data-driven assessment of NBA player statistics, offering valuable insights into the players' individual performances, their contributions to their respective teams, and the overarching trends within the league. This analysis seeks to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and nuanced nuances that shape the world of NBA basketball.

The project's genesis stemmed from a genuine curiosity to gain a deeper understanding of the NBA's intricacies, foster informed discussions among fellow enthusiasts, and perhaps, put an end to the spirited debates with my brothers regarding NBA teams, players, and their statistics.

# Dataset

To undertake this comprehensive analysis, I have utilized a meticulously curated dataset containing detailed NBA player statistics for the 2022-23 season. This dataset encompasses a wealth of information, including but not limited to:

- Player demographics, including age and position.
- Performance metrics such as points scored, assists, rebounds, and field goal percentages.
- Team affiliations, games played, and minutes on the court.

This dataset forms the foundation upon which this analysis is constructed, enabling a thorough examination of NBA player and team dynamics.

# Python Concepts Applied

Throughout the course of this project, I have harnessed several critical Python concepts and libraries to facilitate data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization. These encompass:

- Data cleaning and manipulation using Pandas.
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
- Correlation analysis to uncover relationships between variables.

# Use Cases

This project comprises a series of use cases, each designed to address specific aspects of NBA player and team analysis. These use cases include:

# Use Case 1: Player Age Distribution
- Investigate the age distribution of NBA players in the 2022-23 season.

# Use Case 2: Highest Scoring Players
- Identify the top-performing players based on points per game (PPG).

# Use Case 3: Relationship Between Games Started and Assists
- Analyze the correlation between games started and assists among players.

# Use Case 4: Correlation Matrix
- Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix between various player statistics.

# Use Case 5: Team-Level Analysis - Average PPG by Team
- Analyze the average points per game (PPG) for each NBA team in the 2022-23 season.

# Use Case 6: Box Plot of Player Points Per Game (PPG) by Position
- Create box plots to visualize the distribution of PPG by player position.

# Use Case 7: Player Efficiency Rating (PER)
- Identify the top 10 players with the highest Player Efficiency Rating (PER).
